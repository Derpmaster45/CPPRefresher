# CPPRefresher
Me going back through C++ for the first time in an application sense. 
I figured I would start by going back to basics. I am streaming this entire process on twitch and having alot of fun with it.
This goes hand in hand with me learning C++'s use in UE4/5. I will add changes and fix error as I find them.
